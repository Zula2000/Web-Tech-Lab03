#Task
Visit a web-site that you are familiar with and use reasonably frequently. Without looking at the underlying HTML just yet, build your own version of the site, but applying semantic HTML tags to organise the content. You should be carefully considering how the different “types” of information that make up the page(s) work together. Obviously your site won’t look anything like the original, because we won’t be styling it, but the idea is to gain extra practise considering how sites of different types can organise their content.

For this I chose to use a website i used a lot called https://scryfall.com/
